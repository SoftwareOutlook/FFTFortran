\section{Fast Fourier Transforms}\label{Sec:FFT}


Assuming indexing starts at 1, the discrete 1D Fourier transform of a
vector $x$ of length $n$ is defined as
\begin{equation}\label{Eqn:fft}
  z(k) = \sum_{m=1}^{n} x(m) \exp(-2\pi i (k-1) (m-1) / n), \quad l=1,\ldots,n.
\end{equation}
In this work, we consider FFT libraries that have both multi-threading
(OpenMP) and MPI capabilities.

\subsection{Half-complex format}
For input data that is purely real, the discrete Fourier transform satisfies 
the ``Hermitian'' redundancy: in 1D, if $x$ is a real array, then $z$ computed 
via (\ref{Eqn:fft}) will be a complex array satisfying
$$z(k) = \left[z(n-k+2)\right]^*, \quad k=2,\ldots,n.$$ Also note that the 
imaginary part of $z(1)$ is always 0; for $n$ even, the imaginary part of 
$z(n/2 + 1) $ is also always 0. This special symmetry in $z$ is known as 
\textit{half-complex} format and means that it can 
be stored more efficiently using a real array $y$ of length $n.$ The method of 
storing $z$ in $y$ will vary according to the library being used but one 
possibility is to define the values of $y$ as
\begin{eqnarray*}
y(1) & = & real(z(1)),\\
y(i) & = & real(z(i)), \quad i=2,\ldots,\lfloor n/2 \rfloor +1,\\
y(n-i+2) & = & imag(z(i)), \quad i=2,\ldots, \lfloor (n+1)/2  \rfloor.
\end{eqnarray*} 
Half-complex format can 
be extended to more dimensions. Note that if the input vector $x$ is 
half-complex format, then $z$ will be a real vector.

\section{FFT Libraries and testing environment}\label{Sec:libs}

In this work, we planned to compare the libraries listed in
Table~\ref{Tbl:libs}. We chose libraries that have multithreading
capabilities as well as MPI provision.  The datatypes listed are real
(R), complex (C) and half-complex (H). The column "Dimensions"
indicates the dimensions for which interfaces are provided.  We had
also planned to compare the FFTE (version 6.0) library but the library
is not documented and, when tested, we found that there was no way of
checking whether the subroutine had successfully completed the FFT
calculation and it just returns to the user as if it had been
successful, which can be very dangerous: through our tests, we found
that the MPI version was restrictive on the number of processes that
it could handle, which is not documented, and the OpenMP version was
not reliable. For these reasons, we do not recommend using FFTE.

All benchmark runs were run on ARCHER **ADD REF**, where each compute
node contains two 2.7 GHz, 12-core E5-2697 v2 (Ivy Bridge) series
processors. Each of the cores in these processors can support 2
hardware threads (Hyperthreads) but we do not activate hyperthreading
within our benchmark tests. Within the node, the two processors are
connected by two QuickPath Interconnect (QPI) links. All of our
benchmarks were run on standard compute nodes, which have 64 GB of
memory shared between the two processors. During our benchmark runs,
we set the following environment variables:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{KMP\_AFFINITY} to \texttt{disabled};
\item \texttt{OMP\_NUM\_THREADS} to the number of OpenMP threads;
\item \texttt{MKL\_NUM\_THREADS} to the number of OpenMP threads to
  ensure that the MKL runs use the full number of threads.
\end{itemize}
The benchmarks were launched via \texttt{aprun} with the flags set as
\texttt{-cc none -n \$nprocs -d \$nthreads}, where \texttt{\$nprocs}
is the number of MPI processes and \texttt{nthreads} is the number of
OpenMP threads.

The default modules for FFTW and Intel on ARCHER were used in our
benchmarks, namely, versions 3.3.4.11 and 17.0.0.098,
respectively. The Intel module contains MKL.  P3DFFT version 2.7.9 was
installed by following its installation instructions: the Intel
compiler was used with the default Intel and FFTW modules;
\texttt{configure} was called with the following flags:

\noindent \texttt{--prefix=[LOCAL] -enable-openmp}

\noindent \texttt{--enable-intel --enable-fftw
  --with-fftw=/opt/cray/fftw/default/ivybridge}

\noindent where \texttt{[LOCAL]} was set as a local directory.

\section{Effect of domain size and multithreading for 1D benchmarks}\label{Sec:1DMulti}

In this section, we discuss the benchmark results for libraries that
apply the fast Fourier transform to 1D arrays.  The P3DFFT library
cannot be used on 1D problems and, hence, is excluded. These
benchmarks were performed with the OpenMP versions of FFTW and MKL.

In these benchmarks, we set $n_2=4,$ $n_q=4$ and $n_1=N,$ were $N$ is
defined as follows.  For one set of tests, we let $N=2^k$ for
$k=8,\ldots,30.$ For the other set of tests, $N$ is defined to be the
closest prime number to $2^k,$ $k=8,\ldots,20:$ if two primes are
equidistant, we choose the larger one.


\subsection{1D FFTW Library}\label{Sec:1DFFTW}
For values of $N$ that are powers of 2, we could only perform
computations up to $2^{14}$ due to the Fortran to C interface relying on
C\_INTPTR\_T, which, on ARCHER, has size 4 bytes. This similarly
restricted how large we could take $N$ when it was prime.

In Figure~\ref{1DFFTW}, we compare single node experiments for FFTW
with 1, 4 and 16 OpenMP threads ($thr$). We provide both the initialisation
time ``INIT'' for the FFT library call and the DFT computation time
``DFT''.  The initialisation times for prime values of $N$ are
significantly larger than when $N$ is a power of 2. Increasing the
number of threads also increases the initialisation times but we note
that the difference in initialisation time gets smaller as $N$
increases for the complex-valued case. For real signals, only the
largest value of $N=2^{14}$ sees an advantage of using four threads
instead of a single threads when computing the DFT but there is no
advantage of using 16 threads. When the signal is complex-valued, for
values of $N$ smaller than $2^{12}$ the single thread is optimal but
there is a small improvement using 16 threads when $N=2^{14}$.

To further understand the results, we provide Table~\ref{Tbl:FFTW1d},
which provides the (wall clock) execution times of the initialisation
stage and the DFT calculations along with their ratio with respect to
one thread for $thr=1,$ 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 24. Results for both real
and complex input signals are given for $N=2048,$ 2053, 16381 and
16384.

For $N=2048$ and $N=2053$ with real input signals, we start by
noting that both the initialisation and DFT times tend to increase as
the number of threads increases. This is not unsurprising because they
are very small problems. The
initialisation times are between 13.2 and 19.8 times larger when $N$
is prime compared to $N$ being a power of 2 ($thr=1$ had the smallest
ratio); the DFT computation times are 5.5 and 11.5 times larger for
the prime value of $N$ compare with $N$ being a power of 2 (the
smallest ratio was for $thr=8$). For $N=2048,$ the initialisation time
is between 3400 and 7500 times larger than the average time to perform
one DFT: in general, the ratio decreased as the number of threads
increased. When $N=2053,$ the initialisation time was between 5300 and
14250 times larger than the average DFT time with the lower ratios
occuring for the larger values of $thr.$

For complex-valued signals and $N=2048$ or 2053, increasing the number
of threads also increases the wallclock times. When $N$ is a power of
2 ($N=2048$), the initialisation times are between a factor of 8.0 and
9.6 times smaller than for the nearest prime value of $N;$ the DFT
times are between a factor of 7.7 and 4.4 times smaller. When
$N=2048,$ the initialisation times are between 4290 and 10600 times
larger than the average DFT time; for $N=2053,$ the ratio between
initialisation and DFT times is between 4933 and 13300. In both cases,
the ratio drops as the number of threads increases and, for each value
of $thr,$ the ratio is larger for $N=2053$ than that of $n=2048.$
